# UFO Hunter

<br/>

This is the game UFO Hunter that i did on a Javascript course. The game consist basically in a spaceship shooting against aliens, and the aliens shoot back. The spaceship can move to the right and the left and shoot. The aliens also shoot against the player and he has to avoid the shoots. 

The game has a life counter and one life is lost every time the aliens hit the spaceship. It also has a level counter, and you can go to the next level when you defeat all the aliens.
